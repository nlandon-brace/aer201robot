Quality control is an important task, and at the same time a tedious
one. Time consuming to do by hand, it is costly for many companies,
and it is generally desired that the process can be cheapened and
expedited. In the case of a product with simple operation and modes
of failure, this desire is only intensified, since the expense
involved in manual testing seems entirely inappropriate. So the
ability to automate quality control, to carry it out more quickly and
thus at a lower expense of labour, is certainly to be desired, and in
this day and age with readily available tools and techniques of
automation, indeed seems necessary. It is to this end that we propose
an automated system to test the LED candle lights produced by the manufacturer [fn:1]. 

Each LED candle light is simple to operate, only requiring the
sliding of a single linear switch, which can easily be operated by a
machine. Further, there are only two, related, modes of failure of
concern: either the LED does not flicker, or it does not turn on at
all. Given the low complexity of these devices, automation is clearly
feasible for quality control purposes. This proposal further
demonstrates that feasibility, and further shows the manner in which
this automation could be implemented at a low initial cost so as to
reduce expense in the future.

[fn:1] What should we call this company? Current phrasing is a tad awkward.
